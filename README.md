 # Crimson Crusade

â€œCrimson Crusade" is a hack-and-slash style game created using the PyGame library for Python. In this game, the player takes on the role of a heroic warrior battling through endless waves of enemies in a medieval-fantasy world. 

The "crimson-crusade-pygame" repository contains all the source code for the game, along with any necessary assets (such as images and sound effects). This game was submitted as my final project in a CSC101 class, it demonstrates proficiency in programming concepts such as object-oriented programming, game mechanics, and PyGame.

Please note that while the game is fully functional, it currently lacks some features such as the ability to upgrade weapons, magic-abilities, and attributes, as well as level design and a variety of enemies and bosses. This project was completed within a limited timeframe as a demonstration of proficiency in Python.

Feel free to download and modify the code for your own projects or to learn more about PyGame development. Contributions and suggestions for improvements are always welcome!
